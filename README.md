# ⛄️❄️ Shopify DS Intern Challenge Winter 2022 ❄️⛄️ 

I decided to use this repo to upload and share my work for anyone that might be interested. Above you should find 2 important files regarding the Shopify DS Intern Challenge. 

The first file is an IPython Notebook that I used to answer the first question regarding AOV and appropriate performance metrics. I figured it would make sense to read in the .xlsx file provided as a pandas DataFrame that way I could perform some basic exploratory data analysis. In case github has trouble loading this file I have put it within a google colaboratory notebook that you can find [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wXgs6aRazh0dADRu7RrDuLOlMNzIeGB9?authuser=2).

The second file is a Markdown file that I used to format my responses for question 2. I was unsure of the best file format to post my SQL queries and corresponding answers, but I figured a combination of Markdown and HTML would do the trick. Each part is denoted alphabetically and contains both a query statement and an answer structured as an ordered, numerically labeled list.

## Tasks Completed
- [x] Question 1
- [x] Question 2
